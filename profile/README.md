## What is CHITUBOX Pro?  

**CHITUBOX Pro** is a full-featured 3D printing slicer aimed at **maximizing print quality while minimizing manual adjustments**. It includes printer-specific profiles that automatically optimize layer height, exposure time, and support structures for a wide range of LCD and resin printers.  

The software comes with **advanced support generation tools**, including customizable tree supports, lattice structures, and intelligent base placement, reducing print failures and material usage. Users can also fine-tune settings like anti-aliasing, resin exposure, and layer curing to achieve professional-level results.  

Batch processing capabilities allow **multiple models to be prepared and sliced simultaneously**, which saves time for users managing large print jobs. Its intuitive interface combines **drag-and-drop model placement, automatic hollowing, and preview tools**, ensuring a smooth workflow from 3D model to finished print.  

CHITUBOX Pro also supports **macOS and Windows**, with a wide array of printer compatibility for both hobbyist and professional use. Designers, engineers, and hobbyists alike benefit from its **high-speed slicing engine**, detailed print simulation, and real-time error detection.
